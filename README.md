# Modified shadcn/ui Drawer

I made a change to the behavior of the drawer with the context API. I needed a mobile menu, and by default, there is no component with this functionality, so I adapted the styles, based on the Drawer direction.

## Technologies used

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## How to use

To use it, you can follow the step-by-step instructions in the shadcn/ui documentation and install the Drawer component.

After configuration and installation, simply copy the file in ./src/components/ui/drawer.tsx to the same directory in your project.
